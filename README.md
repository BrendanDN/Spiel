## Preface

[Spiel](https://spiel.pages.dev/?content=home) is the alternative live streaming service that believes in freedom for the creator and independence from the algorithm; This is because we believe in the liberation of the user as the path to a healthy lifestyle for streamers and viewers as well as believing it to be the factor enabling the crafting of content for the soul.

The start of liberation is a decentralized system for user creation and authentication; [GUN.js](https://gun.eco/) is an open-source cybersecurity protocol for syncing decentralized graph data, it is also the backbone of Spiel's user system. This means that when you create an account with Spiel, instead of **your** data being stored in a server that is controlled by someone else who you don't know and which could *potentially* be vulnerable to a data leak, it is safely and securely stored on your device where you are given control of your data. Although this is the more private solution there is a trade-off; If you were to try and login into your account from a new or different device you will get an error message. The reason for this is that Spiel (as we have said) stores user data on that device, so the user data can only be accessed from that device unlike if it were to be stored on a server that could be accessed from anywhere, but that same server could also be accessed by anyone including hackers with malicious intent who could break through that very same servers security if that server has security in the first place. To learn more about our shared goals and to find out more about how user data is handled you can read this: [gun.eco/docs/Auth](https://gun.eco/docs/Auth).

Another objective of Spiel is independence from the algorithm; The algorithm, by the nature of what it is, is a computer program, that cannot judge the underlying message of a video, so video recommendations are rated by the data around the video which would be viewes and not the data in the video; A system like that can be abused by posting shocking and appalling content for the sole purpose of getting clicks which equate to views. This then could lead to creators spending little time in creating videos with substance and putting no thought into any ethical implications videos may have and all their time into building algorithm-friendly videos. This then could and sometimes has led to disturbing trends being spread through internet culture which spiral out of control leading to these in-human messages being imprinted into the minds of our society. Instead, on Spiel creator discovery is driven by the 'Share Creator Button' which allows **streamers and viewers** to introduce friends and followers to your stream through your unique Spiel link through which control can be given back to the user and promotes the involvement of human judgment into the equation of internet success. This button can be found under every stream and in the *'Live Tab'*.

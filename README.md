### Preface

Spiel is the alternative live streaming service that believes in freedom for the creator and independence from the algorithm; This is owing to the fact that we belive in the liberation of the user as the path to a healthy lifestyle for streamers and viewers as well as liberation being the factor to enable the crafting of content for the soul.

The start of liberation is a decentralized system for user creation and authentication; [GUN.js](https://gun.eco/) is an open source cybersecurity protocol for syncing decentralized graph data and the backbone to Spiels user system. What this means for you is that when you create an account whith Spiel, instead of **your** data being stored in a server that is controlled by someone else who you dont know and could *potentially* be vunerable to a data leak, it is safely and securly stored on you device were you are given controll of your data. Although this is the more private solution there is a trade-off; If you were to try and login into your account from a new or different device you will get an error message. The reason for this is that Spiel (as we have said) stores user data on that device, so the user data can only be accessed from that device unlike if it were to be stored on a server that could be accessed from anywere, but that same server could also be accesed by anyone including hackers with malicious intent who could break through that very same servers security (if that server has security in the first place) To learn more about our shared goals and to find out more about how user data is handeled you can read this: [gun.eco/docs/Auth](https://gun.eco/docs/Auth)

Another objective of Spiel is independence from the algorithm; The algorithm, by the nature of what it is cannot judge the underling message of a video which then leads to disturbing trends being spread through internet culture which spiral out of control leading to these in-human messages being inprinted into the minds of our society. Instead, on Spiel creator discovery is driven by the 'Share Creator Button' which allows **streamers and viewers** to introduce friends and followers to your stream through your unique Spiel link through which controll can be given back to the user and promotes the involvement human judgment into the equation of internet succes. This button can be found under every stream and in the 'Live Tab'.
